# Society Thinks
Society Thinks is a website designed by myself and Marc Pittinsky ([@marclanepitt](https://github.com/marclanepitt)) as our final project in COMP 426, Advanced Web Technologies at UNC Chapel Hill. The site is a simple, yet feature-rich social media platform in which users can ask and answer questions, and then filter the results demographically.

# Dependencies
The site currently stores its database on UNC servers, and is therefore only accessible through connection to the UNC network via a VPN client. The recommended client is Cisco AnyConnect.
The latest version of PHP is required, with the MySQL library enabled. The server can be hosted by any method, but must be rooted in the folder of the Society-Thinks repository. Recommended hosting methods include the built-in PHP host and a software such as XAMPP.

# Get Started
After obtaining the dependencies above and starting the server, navigate [here](http://localhost:8000/templates/index.html) to begin using the site!
