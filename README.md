# Society Thinks
Society Thinks is a website designed by myself and Marc Pittinsky ([@marclanepitt](https://github.com/marclanepitt)) as our final project in COMP 426, Advanced Web Technologies at UNC Chapel Hill. The site is a simple, yet feature-rich social media platform in which users can ask and answer questions, and then filter the results demographically.
The site is currently hosted on Heroku at https://societythinks.herokuapp.com/templates/index.html

# Development
### Dependencies
For further development and testing, a server can be run on port 8000 and with its root directory as the Society-Thinks folder. This can be done using a built-in PHP test server or a third-party software such as XAMPP (ensure that MySQL is enabled in either case). Once this is done, navigate to https://localhost:8000/templates/index.html to view the site.
